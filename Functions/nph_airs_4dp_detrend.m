% 1-D cross-track polynomial fit.

% with no dimension argument specified: we expect IN to be AIRS Temperature in XTxATxAlt dimensions, that is, we will be taking
% the fit across the FIRST dimension.

% [perturbations,background] = nph_airs_4dp_detrend(IN,dim,polyorder);

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% EDIT JULY 2020
% I've noticed that the polynomial fit seems to be sensitive to the
% direction of the data that's put in in - that is, you get a different fit
% if you put the same data in but the order of the elements is reversed.
% This shouldn't happen! Bad!
% FIXED - I think. I changed the dummy spatial vector to be balanced around
% zero.
% I also took out the mean removal step once I'd fixed this. It could be
% thrown off by weird data so didn't want to risk it.

% % % % EDIT: Now removed vvvvv
% % % % one key difference is that the mean is calculated seperately, rather than
% % % % fitted by the matrix division.
% % % % One reason this seems to be helping is that by making the mean zero, you
% % % % don't get some of the higher order terms trying to fit the mean and they
% % % % are left to fit the higher order features. This shouldn't work, but it
% % % % seems to, so perhaps I don't understand how the maths works :)
